Description: 
In this assignment we'll use test driven development to create the program we discussed in homework 1.
Follow test first coding, don't write any code unless a failing test demands it. Write minimum code to make tests pass. Start early and take very small steps. 
Keep your tests passing at all times. Keep the design lightweight and the code quality high.

Complete this:
After the implementation is complete (and only after it's complete), compare the design created in Assignment 1 with the design you described in Homework 1.

Changes that were made to the design are the following:
   1: A completely new object 'UnitTest' was added for implementing the Test Driven Development
       a)Because of this, a new instance field was added to Main()
   2: UserBirthDate needed new methods to allow the UnitTest to operate properly.
       a)Added equals method
       b)Added toString method
       c)Added FromString static method...Used to build UserBirthDate from String



NOTE: 
Make sure you commit to SVN after each iteration. This will help TA to verify the TDD transition.
